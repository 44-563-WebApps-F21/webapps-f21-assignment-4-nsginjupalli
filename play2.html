            <p>_Drawing-room in Lord Windermere’s house_.  _Door R.U. opening into
            ball-room_, _where band is playing_.  _Door L. through which guests are
            entering_.  _Door L.U. opens on to illuminated terrace_.  _Palms_,
            _flowers_, _and brilliant lights_.  _Room crowded with guests_.  _Lady
            Windermere is receiving them_. <br>
<h4 class="name LADYWINDMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h4> <p class="speech"> Yes.  Her coming here is monstrous, unbearable.  I know
now what you meant to-day at tea-time.  Why didn’t you tell me right out?
You should have!</p>

<h4 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"></h4> LORD DARLINGTON.  <p class="speech">  I couldn’t!  A man can’t tell these things about
another man!  But if I had known he was going to make you ask her here
to-night, I think I would have told you.  That insult, at any rate, you
would have been spared.</p>

<h4 class="name LADYWINDMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h4> <p class="speech">LADY WINDERMERE.  I did not ask her.  He insisted on her coming—against
my entreaties—against my commands.  Oh! the house is tainted for me!  I
feel that every woman here sneers at me as she dances by with my husband.
What have I done to deserve this?  I gave him all my life.  He took
it—used it—spoiled it!  I am degraded in my own eyes; and I lack
courage—I am a coward!  [_Sits down on sofa_.]</p>

<h4 class="name LORDDARLINGTON"></h4> LORD DARLINGTON. ]<p class="speech"> LORD DARLINGTON.  If I know you at all, I know that you can’t live with a
man who treats you like this!  What sort of life would you have with him?
You would feel that he was lying to you every moment of the day.  You
would feel that the look in his eyes was false, his voice false, his
touch false, his passion false.  He would come to you when he was weary
of others; you would have to comfort him.  He would come to you when he
was devoted to others; you would have to charm him.  You would have to be
to him the mask of his real life, the cloak to hide his secret.</p>

<h4 class="name LADYWINDMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h4> <p class="speech">LADY WINDERMERE.  You are right—you are terribly right.  But where am I
to turn?  You said you would be my friend, Lord Darlington.—Tell me, what
am I to do?  Be my friend now.</p>
